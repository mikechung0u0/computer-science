#an example of repeating code without a loop

#an example of a for loop 
#i is a variable that is used as a counter (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
#5 is the ending value for the counter

for i in range(5):
    print("Good Evening my neighbor", i)

#print "hello world" seven times (7)
for i in range(7):
    print("hello world", i)

#While loop - repeats until a condition is met
number = 0
while(number < 10):
    print("I love computer science", number)
    number = number + 1


#student loop
for student in range(21):
    print("student#", student + 1, "is amazing")


#for loop
for i in range(3):
    print("I am a master of my own fate", i)

#while loop
i = 0
while(i < 10):
    print("I know computer science", i)
    i = i + 1

#while loop using booleans
